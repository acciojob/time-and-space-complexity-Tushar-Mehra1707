	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity, efficient measures how an algorithm's execution time grows as the input size increases, helping assess its efficiency and scalability. Algorithms with lower time complexity are generally preferred for handling larger inputs efficiently. 
</p>
	<b>
		<p>Space Complexity, O(n)Space complexity is essentially a parallel concept to time complexity. If you need to create an array of size n, this will take O(n) space. If you build a two-dimensional array of size n*n, this will need O(n2) space. Space complexity is dependent on several factors.
